```{r}

```


This is an R Markdown document used to help analyze STRaitRazor output, both individualy and as a group of samples using R. 

If you want to analyze an individual sample you first must define the file path of your STRaitRazor output.
To do that use this command:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
seq_dir <- setwd("STRaitRazor2.0output/your_path_here")
```

Then run this code:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
process_single_sample(seq_dir) 
```
And this will output a file called single_summary.csv!

If you want to analyze an multiple samples you first must define the directory paths of your STRaitRazor output.
To do that use this command:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sample_dirs <- list.dirs("STRaitRazor2.0output", recursive = F) %>% 
                    paste0("your_path_here")
```

Where your_path_here  

Then run this code:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
batch_process_samples(sample_dirs) 
```
And this will output a file called summary.csv!
